                        De-Anonymization Simulator

This project seek for providing a simulator for the De-Anonymmization problem.

Files description :
  -Makefile automates the compilation.
  -primary_graph.ml provides a basic imperative implementation of non orientes
  labelled graphs with some other generic functions usefull to the
  de-anonymization problem.
  -perm.ml provides an implementation of permutations of [0 ... n-1] with some
  functions.
  -ER_graph.ml is an Erdos-Renyi graph generator.
  -C_graph.ml is a graph generator for the configuration model.
  -PA_graph.ml is a graph generator for the preferencial attachment model.
  -FPS.ml allows to simulate a random variable that takes values in [0 ... n-1]
  with a given probability.
  -Pedarsani_Grossglauser.ml is an attack based on the article of Pedram
  Pedarsani and Matthias Grossglauser "On the Privacy of Anonymized Networks"
  -Korula_Lattanzi.ml is an attack based on the article of Nitish Korula and
  Silvio Lattanzi "An efficient reconciliation algorithm for social networks"
  -Blackstrom_Dwork_Kleinberg.ml is an attack based on the article of Lars
  Backstrom Cynthia Dwork and Jon Kleinberg "Wherefore Art Thou R35579X?
  Anonymized Social Networks, Hidden Paterns, and Structural Steganography"
